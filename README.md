## Wavelength client

A basic interface for playing the board game [Wavelength](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/262543/wavelength) online during the pandemic.
Hosted at https://borlaym.github.io/wavelength/

Doesn't support multiple rooms, it was just used for my game group. Uses firebase for real time synchronization.
